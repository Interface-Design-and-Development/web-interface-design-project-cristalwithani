        <p>At Luna Whirl, we believe yogurt should be a little magical.
        Born under a swirl of stars and stirred with imagination, Luna Whirl blends the creamy goodness of traditional yogurt with cosmic creativity. Our mission is to bring joy to your snack time with flavors that sparkle, ingredients you can trust, and a spirit of fun in every spoonful.
        Founded by dreamers, taste-testers, and flavor alchemists, Luna Whirl is more than just yogurt — it’s a tiny escape in a cup. Whether you’re craving a fruity orbit or a vanilla voyage, every bite is a celebration of bold taste and better choices.
        Welcome to our galaxy of flavor.</p>

          <p>Luna Whirl was founded by Mira Solana, a botanical chef and lifelong moon-gazer who grew up on a lavender farm under starry skies. Inspired by her grandmother’s belief that the moon could influence flavor, Mira began blending fruits and florals into yogurt that felt… magical.
          One night, with a spoonful of blueberry-lavender yogurt and a sky full of stars, she dreamed up Luna Whirl — a yogurt brand inspired by celestial moments, crafted with care, and made to taste like something from another world.</p>
